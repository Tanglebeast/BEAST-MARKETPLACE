      <h2 className='mt50'>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        1.1 This Privacy Policy describes how TANGLESPACE (hereinafter referred to as "Marketplace") collects, processes, and uses personal data of users (hereinafter referred to as "Users"). By using the Marketplace, Users agree to this Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        1.2 TANGLESPACE is a decentralized platform that facilitates the trading of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). The platform operates without central control and all actions and transactions take place on the blockchain.
      </p>

      <h2 className='mt50'>2. Collection and Processing of Personal Data</h2>
      <p>
        2.1 Users connect through their wallet to access the Marketplace. This connection is made via blockchain technologies, and no additional personal data is collected or processed during this connection.
      </p>
      <p>
        2.2 Users can create a username, which is stored in a Smart Contract. This username is not linked to the user's real name and serves only for identification within the Marketplace.
      </p>
      <p>
        2.3 Users have the ability to change or remove their username independently without needing assistance from the Marketplace. These changes are made directly through the Marketplaceâ€™s features.
      </p>
      <p>
        2.4 Apart from the username stored in the Smart Contract and transaction data recorded on the blockchain, the Marketplace does not collect or store any additional personal data.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        4.2 The Marketplace may disclose data when required to fulfill legal obligations or to protect the rights and safety of the Marketplace.
      </p>

      <h2 className='mt50'>5. Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        5.1 The Marketplace implements reasonable security measures to protect user data. However, due to the decentralized nature of the platform, absolute guarantees cannot be provided.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.2 Users are responsible for keeping their wallet access credentials and private keys secure.
      </p>

        6.1 Users have the right to request information about the data stored in the Smart Contract, such as their username.
      </p>
      <p>
        6.2 Users can directly modify their username through the Marketplace features. For corrections to other data, users may make the necessary changes themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        6.3 Users can remove their username themselves if desired. Complete deletion of data is not possible within the decentralized structure of the Marketplace. However, users can terminate their wallet and, thereby, their connection to the Marketplace.
      </p>
